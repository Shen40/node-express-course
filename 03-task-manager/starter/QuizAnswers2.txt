1. In this lesson, you created a middleware function 
called asyncWrapper. Why?
Ans: To avoid the redundant and lengthly try and catch blocks

2. Suppose that you want to make sure that 
both a status code and an error message 
are sent back to the user when they request 
the URL for a task that does not exist. 
Assume that you’ve created a CustomAPIError 
class and an error handler that references that class.

Complete the code:

const getTask = asyncWrapper(async (req, res, next) => {  
  const { id: taskID } = req.params;  
  const task = await Task.findOne({ _id: taskID });  
  if (!task) {  
    // your code here  
    return res.status(404).json({msg:'task does not exist'})
  }  
  res.status(200).json({ task });  
});
